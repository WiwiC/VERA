# This tutorial shows how to deploy the project on a VPS (AWS in my case) running Ubuntu
# Once connected to the machine, run these commands (line by line):

# Install and update libraries on the machine
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt install unzip

# I previously imported the project .zip file to the machine (using the scp tool)
unzip VERA-main.zip
cd VERA-main

# Install Docker
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker


sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
docker --version

# Create the container
docker build -t vera .

# Run the container
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8501:8501 --name vera vera

# From here, the docker will be deployed and if there are no issues, you should be able to reach the application from the internet using the server's public address. Don't forget to include the port as well
# Example: 123.45.678.910:8501
# Don't forget to open this port in the server's firewall.

# To verify if the container is running correctly
docker ps

# The logs (in case there are any prints)
docker logs -f vera

# To stop the docker
docker stop vera

# To delete the container
docker rm vera
